  `<p>Building my portfolio site was a mix of applying familiar design and coding skills while also facing new challenges as a learner. Choosing GitHub Pages instead of drag-and-drop builders like Wix allowed me to work closely with the code and design, which suits my style of hands-on exploration.</p>
  <p>An important feature I wanted was a weather widget, so I had to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. This allowed me to access real-time weather data that updates automatically. I also came up with the idea to request the user's location with a prompt notification, respecting privacy concerns since some people might not want their location visible or shared. This made the experience more user-friendly and transparent.</p>
  <p>Throughout the process, I encountered issues like broken layouts from small typos, inconsistent styling, and menus not linking correctly. These challenges required careful troubleshooting and multiple revisions. At times, it was frustrating when a single missing bracket caused the page to break, but solving these problems brought a rewarding sense of accomplishment.</p>
  <p>AI tools like ChatGPT supported me by offering suggestions and helping refine my ideas. Rather than handing me answers, the AI guided me to consider alternative solutions—like having a resourceful brainstorming partner along the way. This was particularly useful when quick fresh ideas were needed.</p>
  <p>I also relied heavily on community resources such as GitHub documentation, Stack Overflow, and conversations with classmates. Collaborating this way added a welcome social dimension, contrasting with the more independent work I usually do.</p>
  <p>Emotionally, the process moved from curiosity and excitement to moments of irritation during debugging, and finally to satisfaction as the site came together to reflect my vision. This experience felt similar to how I approach new projects—through trial, error, and reflection—more than following a strict step-by-step formula.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, this project reinforced that being an effective learner means staying patient, open-minded, and willing to work through challenges independently, regardless of prior experience.</p>`

const prod2Reflection = `<p>Indigenous Knowledge as Relational Practice Transforming Education</p>
  <p>Brayboy and Maughan’s (2008) Indigenous Knowledges and the Story of the Bean challenges Western education by emphasizing knowledge as a lived, relational process vital to community survival. They argue that “Indigenous knowledges… are lived and integral to survival. Truth and knowledge cannot be ends in and of themselves” (pp. 11–12), critiquing the Western tendency to treat knowledge as abstract facts. They further stress that “knowledge is not… a commodity that can be possessed or controlled by educators but rather a process that can be absorbed and understood” (p. 12), highlighting knowledge’s ethical, ongoing nature. These insights invite educators to ground learning in accountability and context rather than isolated content.</p>
  <p>The Story of the Bean illustrates knowledge embedded in Indigenous cosmology and community responsibility, contrasting Western schooling’s linear, individualistic approach. As highlighted in our class chart, Indigenous education values communal, nonlinear learning. The call for teachers to “have something at stake” in their communities (Brayboy & Maughan, 2008, p. 9) reflects this relational ethics, positioning educators as responsible participants in learners’ environments.</p>
  <p>A key concept is viewing knowledge as a verb, a living practice enacted through relationships, rather than a noun or fixed object. This challenges curriculum and assessments to privilege engagement, reflection, and responsibility over rote memorization.</p>
  <p>This relational approach extends into digital realms, seen in projects like He Ao Hou: A New World (Kanaeokana, 2020) and Indigenous Virtual Reality platforms (CBC, 2018). These initiatives immerse learners in ancestral language and stories, integrating tradition and innovation while reclaiming Indigenous presence in modern technology.</p>
  <p>Within Computer Technology education, part of my Bachelor of Basic Teaching program, this framework offers Indigenous learners’ opportunities beyond environmental applications. They can develop language revitalization apps or culturally grounded educational tools, becoming creators and entrepreneurs who shape solutions grounded in their cultural contexts.</p>
  <p>Advanced technologies such as 3D printing and virtual reality amplify this potential, allowing Indigenous innovators to prototype and share ideas globally while maintaining cultural integrity. This synthesis honors Indigenous knowledge’s dynamic nature and supports learners in pioneering new scientific and technological pathways.</p>
  <p>However, challenges to integrating Indigenous Knowledge in mainstream education remain. Indigenous Knowledges are diverse and sometimes internally contested, resisting singular narratives and risking romanticization (Levac et al., 2018; ABC Life Literacy Canada, 2024). Mainstream education’s emphasis on standardized content and assessment often conflicts with Indigenous relational and contextual ways of knowing (Sosyalarastirmalar, 2025). Institutional barriers, including limited Indigenous leadership and funding, further complicate authentic inclusion (People for Education, 2016). Overcoming these challenges requires epistemic pluralism and respectful dialogue valuing multiple knowledge systems equally.</p>
  <p>Supporting Indigenous learners to innovate requires more than curriculum shifts. Educational spaces must make technology meaningful culturally and practically. For example, coding language apps connects technical skills with cultural preservation. Addressing infrastructure gaps like limited internet access is critical. Mentorship from Indigenous technology professionals offers both guidance and identity affirmation. Project-based learning tied to community challenges fosters critical thinking and relevance. Teacher training in culturally sustaining pedagogy builds trust and respect, essential for deep learning. Finally, policies must empower Indigenous leadership and secure funding. These combined efforts create environments where Indigenous learners thrive academically, culturally, and creatively.</p>
  <p>Brayboy and Maughan assert that “Indigenous knowledge systems are inherently political and ethical projects rooted in survival and sovereignty” (2008, p. 22). This frames Indigenous Knowledges as central, not peripheral, to education and inclusion. Honoring these systems affirms Indigenous students’ identities and ways of knowing, fostering relational accountability, critical reflection, and community engagement. While primarily supporting Indigenous learners’ success and well-being, this inclusive approach invites all students into a richer, more ethical education, one that embraces knowledge as dynamic and culturally grounded. Thus, Indigenous Knowledge inclusion is not only an ethical imperative but a transformative expansion of educational practice for the benefit of all.</p>`;
